# Readme

If you run `cargo new packageName` then Cargo will setup a new project for you.

1. a folder named `packageName` is created
2. that includes a `src` folder with a hello world type `main.rs`
3. a `Cargo.toml` package information file is created

If you run `cargo init` instead, then a Cargo project will be created in the current folder. Additionally, if the folder is a Git repo, `/target` is added to the `.gitignore` file.
